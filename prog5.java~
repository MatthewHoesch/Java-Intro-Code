/* In the game of craps, a bet procedes as follows: Two six sided dice are rolled; the first roll of the dice in craps is the come out roll. A come out roll of 7 or 11 wins, and a come out of 2,3 or 12 loses. If 4,5,6,8,9,or 10 are rolled on the come out roll, that number becomes "the point." The player keeps rolling the dice until either 7 or the point is rolled. If the point is rolled first, then the player wins the bet. If a 7 is rolled first, then the player loses. Write a program that simulates a craps using these rules without human input.

Variable Dictionary:
dice1= The first dice.
dice2= The second dice.
i= 
roll= THe roll of the two dice.
wincount= The amount of wins.
losecount= The amount of loses.
probability= The frequency of wins 

Input:
------
Output:
Total amout of wins, Total amount of losses, Probability of winning.
